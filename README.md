# HomeWork#10 Employees Profile Info

## Table of Content
1. Package.jason installation (npm and inquirer)
1. index.js
1. HTML Template (employeeProfile.js)
1. HTML Styles (styles.css)

## What I Learned:
In this project I rehearese how to install the package.json library. Once the package was installed, I created the index.js which contain the questions that will be printed at the terminal so the user can state her/his imput. This was really fun to do and studing the main at the HomeWork folder I could take out some validators tips for the IDs and emails.

Once the index.js was created, I continued with the HTML Template so the input prints over it. For this I created a real index.html and place all the information, from the Meta to the Body. When the index.html was complete I proceed with the styles.css to garnish the HTML.

When the HTML and the syles were finishes I copied the indx.html code and place it at the employeeProfile.js, ran the terminal and it worked üòÅ

I really liked this activity because it envolves a lot of what we have been studding!!!
